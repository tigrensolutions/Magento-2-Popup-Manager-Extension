It is immensely convenient that you are able to choose any pages on your website to display popups. A popup can be displayed on <em>all pages</em> or only <em>a specific one</em> with just a few clicks.

Furthermore, in spite of being a range of positions on each page to choose from, all options bring the same results. The reason is that the popups will be most appropriate and eye-catching only when they are in the center of the page so we fixed all popups at this position.

It is essential to analyze indicators of the popups in the statistics in order to know whether you are using those effectively or not. As you can see, the table presents <strong><em>Impressions, Goal Completion, Click Inside Popup, Close Without Interaction,</em></strong> and <strong><em>Window Closed</em></strong>.

![evaluate-popup-effectiveness-in-magento-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26241389/162356694-4b706dfb-99e0-43c7-abe4-614a1d2a5292.png)

Firstly, from the <strong><em>Impressions</em></strong>, we can know how many times the popup is fetched and viewed by customers. Secondly, the <strong><em>Goal Completion</em></strong> indicates the percentage of users accomplishing the popup request (E.g.: for newsletter popup, the <strong><em>Goal Completion</em></strong> is counted when the users send their email address to subscribe), while the <strong><em>Click Inside Popup</em></strong> denotes the percentage of people who only click inside without complete the content. Finally, the <strong><em>Close Without Interaction</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Window Closed</em></strong> reveal the proportion of visitors ignoring and disregarding the popup.
